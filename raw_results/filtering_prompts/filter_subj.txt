Suppose you are an annotator helping me to filter a long list of words of subject nouns. The general criterion for the filtering is to filter out those words that are hard to visualize. Specifically, you should filter out those abstract concepts, general reference or broken words and only keep those concrete references of objects. Here are some examples for you to follow:

1. A binary number: abstract concept, discard.
2. A car bomb: concrete reference, keep.
3. A civilization: general reference, discard.
4. A copy: general reference, discard.
5. All animals: general reference, discard.
6. Infectious diseases: abstract concept, discard.
7. MS: broken words, discard.
8. Police: concrete reference, keep.
9. The 802.11n standard: abstract concept, discard.
10. athletes: concrete reference, keep.
11. the story: abstract concept, discard.
12. the country: general reference, discard.

Now read the words below and only provide the filtered word  (i.e., do not provide the words filtered out in your response):
[150 lines of word]



Concrete vs. Abstract: Retain nouns that represent tangible, physical objects or entities that can be directly observed or interacted with. Discard abstract concepts, ideas, or phenomena that cannot be seen, touched, or physically measured.

Specificity: Keep nouns that refer to specific, identifiable things rather than general categories or groups. For instance, "an apple" (specific) should be kept, while "fruit" (general) should be discarded.

Intactness: Exclude broken words or phrases that do not represent a complete or coherent idea on their own. This includes acronyms or abbreviations that are not universally recognized as stand-alone concepts.

Individuality vs. Collectivity: Prefer nouns that denote individual entities over those that refer to groups, collections, or categories. For example, "a cat" (individual) is preferable to "all animals" (collective).
