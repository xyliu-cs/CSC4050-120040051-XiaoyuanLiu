The goal is to keep concrete actions with action verbs (e.g., "run," "write," "jump," and "play.") and filter out the abstract actions with stative verbs (e.g., "cause," "allow," "know," and "affect") and also discard the broken or misclassified verb phrases. Here are some examples for you to follow:
1. accept a job: abstract action, discard.
2. are a lot: abstract action, discard.
3. become a republic: abstract action, discard.
4. collects water: concrete action, keep.
